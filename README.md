# Hubot


### Testing Hubot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following.

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a
prompt.

    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts
    Hubot>

Then you can interact with hubot by typing `hubot help`.

    Hubot> hubot help

    Hubot> animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds a few
    convert me <expression> to <units> - Convert expression to given units.
    help - Displays all of the help commands that Hubot knows about.
    ...


### Scripting

Take a look at the scripts in the `./scripts` folder for examples.
Delete any scripts you think are useless or boring.  Add whatever functionality you
want hubot to have. Read up on what you can do with hubot in the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).

### Redis Persistence

If you are going to use the `redis-brain.coffee` script from `hubot-scripts`
(strongly suggested), you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified
account or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually
set the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.

    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL="..."

If you don't require any persistence feel free to remove the
`redis-brain.coffee` from `hubot-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry
about redis at all.

## hubot-scripts

There will inevitably be functionality that everyone will want. Instead
of adding it to hubot itself, you can submit pull requests to
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts].

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.

[hubot-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts

## external-scripts

Tired of waiting for your script to be merged into `hubot-scripts`? Want to
maintain the repository and package yourself? Then this added functionality
maybe for you!

Hubot is now able to load scripts from third-party `npm` packages! To enable
this functionality you can follow the following steps.

1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`
2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed

To enable third-party scripts that you've added you will need to add the package
name as a double quoted string to the `external-scripts.json` file in this repo.

## Deployment with Docker

```bash
docker run -e HUBOT_HIPCHAT_JID=xxx@chat.hipchat.com -e HUBOT_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD=password -e HUBOT_HIPCHAT_JOIN_PUBLIC_ROOMS=false --rm=true -d --name=alfred codemancers/hubot
```


## Deployment to Heroku

    % heroku create --stack cedar
    % git push heroku master
    % heroku ps:scale app=1

If your Heroku account has been verified you can run the following to enable
and add the Redis to Go addon to your app.

    % heroku addons:add redistogo:nano

If you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].

You'll need to edit the `Procfile` to set the name of your hubot.

More detailed documentation can be found on the
[deploying hubot onto Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page.

### Deploying to UNIX or Windows

If you would like to deploy to either a UNIX operating system or Windows.
Please check out the [deploying hubot onto UNIX][deploy-unix] and
[deploying hubot onto Windows][deploy-windows] wiki pages.

## HipChat Variables

You will need to set a configuration variable if you are hosting on the free Heroku plan.

    % heroku config:add HEROKU_URL=http://codemancers-hubot.herokuapp.com

Where the URL is your Heroku app's URL (shown after running `heroku create`, or `heroku rename`).

Set the JID to the "Jabber ID" shown on your bot's [XMPP/Jabber account settings](https://www.hipchat.com/account/xmpp):

    % heroku config:add HUBOT_HIPCHAT_JID=<Jabber ID>

Set the password to the password chosen when you created the bot's account.

    % heroku config:add HUBOT_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD=<Bot user password>

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart`
if you're having issues.
